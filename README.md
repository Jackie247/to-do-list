# To-Do-List Application

<h2> Overview </h2>

Live Preview: 

This is my take on the final project for <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list'>The Odin Project: 'Organizing your JavaScript Code'</a> chapter.

This is the culmination of all the foundational topics of their JS lessons, mainly focusing on creating objects using either factories or in my case constructors/classes and using webpack to dynamically load the webpage. 

Tasks within the app should have a title, description, due date and priority. Other features such as a checklist were optional. 

Users should be able to create their own projects and create their own tasks for each seperate project. This is also the first time that localStorage has been introduced within the course which expanded on previous JSON lessons. 

<h2> Key Topics </h2>

The following topics were covered in this project:

* Command-line basics
    * Navigating the file tree
    * Creating, and removing files and directories.
* HTML
    * Increasing my semantic HTML usage, beginning to use elements such as section, textarea.
    * Attributes
* JavaScript
    * Classes
    * Modules
    * DOM Manipulation
* CSS/SASS
    * First time implementing an animation for navbar
    * SASS usage to keep code readable and easily manageable. 
    * Flexbox
    * Dynamic units such as rem, em, vh, vw.
    * Pseudoclasses
* Git workflow
    * git clone
    * git add 
    * git commit
    * git branch
    * git push
    * git pull

<h2> Learning Objectives </h2>

* Becoming more comfortable in developing a full application using objects, classes and modules in JS

* Expanding on my knowledge when it comes to mobile first development and responsive design.

* Familiarity with webpack and NPM packages that are useful in development.
